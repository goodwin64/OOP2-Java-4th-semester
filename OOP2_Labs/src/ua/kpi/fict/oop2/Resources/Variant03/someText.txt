Hi! It's me, Max.
I like programming.
It is a third line.

It was an empty line above. Here is 5th one.
WordWithMaximumCountOfVowels is VeryLongWord :)
Previous line hasn't got a sentence-end mark like dot or question mark so it hasn't been parsed.
UPD: but it has a '\n' on it's end so it has been parsed ;)
The end. Good luck!
